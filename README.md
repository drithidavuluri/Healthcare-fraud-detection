# Healthcare-fraud-detection
The project utilizes popular Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. These libraries provide essential tools for data manipulation, preprocessing, visualization, and implementing machine learning algorithms.

Several clustering algorithms are implemented and compared for anomaly detection in the healthcare data. The algorithms used include:

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): This algorithm assigns data points to clusters based on their similarity to the nearest neighbors. It can be effective in identifying outliers that deviate significantly from the normal patterns.

Isolation Forest: This algorithm uses random forests to isolate anomalies by partitioning the data into smaller subsets. It leverages the fact that anomalies are expected to have shorter path lengths within the tree structure.

SVM (Support Vector Machines): SVM is a powerful algorithm for separating data into different classes. In this project, SVM is adapted for anomaly detection by identifying data points that lie far from the decision boundary.

Detection by Z Score: This method involves calculating the Z score for each data point, which measures how many standard deviations it deviates from the mean. Data points with high Z scores are considered potential anomalies.

By applying these algorithms, the project aims to uncover abnormal patterns in the healthcare data that may indicate fraudulent activities. The results are visualized using Matplotlib to facilitate easy interpretation and analysis.
